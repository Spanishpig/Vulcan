A fancy propkill script

   - This script was made and designed exclusively for propkill. It has visuals, fov, bhop, and a few unique custom concepts I came up with a while ago.
   - We wanted to come up with visually unique looking script, not something similar to 99% of the other propkill scripts around.
   - This script won't help if you want to use it to cheat or be undetected on some other servers. (it will be detected anyways)
   - As this was mainly made for the propkill community, it COULD fuck your fps in case there would be too many players on the server you're on. (propkill servers are rarely very     populated..)
   - Nevertheless, I added a few fps optimization shit to help you: 
   	   - the fps saver convar, you should basically always keep this ON
   	   - you can also disable the additional chams halos which is purely aesthetic and takes a lot of fps when there are too many players to render
   - I'll keep updating this script, according to the feedbacks I'll get.
   - This is NOT a proper cheat. This is a PROPKILL clientside script. Trying to use this on other servers will get you detected and banned unless you have a cool bypass, and as I    mentioned before, your fps will most likely get fucked.
